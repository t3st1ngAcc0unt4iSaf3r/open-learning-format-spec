# üß© Inserting Flip Cards in an OLF File

This guide explains how to create and place interactive flashcards (flip cards) in Open Learning Format (OLF) files using the `flashcard` element in `content.json`.

## üß† What is a Flip Card?

A flip card displays a question or prompt on one side, and flips to show an answer or explanation on the reverse. It is ideal for language learning, terminology, and interactive quizzes.

  "flashcard": {
    "id": "UUID",
    "category": "Tool_FLASH_CARD",
    "question-title": "Front Label",
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",

## üìç Positioning Flip Cards

Flip cards are placed using `x` and `y` fields. Layouts such as a **3x3 grid** can be generated using simple loops.

### Example: Grid Positioning (Python Logic)

```python
rows, cols = 3, 3
card_width, card_height = 400, 200
margin_x, margin_y = 100, 100
spacing_x, spacing_y = 100, 100

for idx in range(rows * cols):
    row = idx // cols
    col = idx % cols
    x = margin_x + col * (card_width + spacing_x)
    y = margin_y + row * (card_height + spacing_y)
```

## üì¶ File Packaging

Make sure your OLF archive contains:

```
/content.json
```

- Place all flip cards in the `elements` array of one or more pages.
- Include any referenced images in an `/images/` folder if used.

## ‚úÖ Summary Checklist

- [x] Use the `flashcard` element with unique UUIDs
- [x] Define `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` for placement
- [x] Provide `question` and `answer` text
- [x] Use `"Tool_FLASH_CARD"` as the `category`
- [x] Include images optionally, or leave blank
